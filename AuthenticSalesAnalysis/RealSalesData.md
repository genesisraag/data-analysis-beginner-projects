Project 2: Sales Performance Analysis using Authentic Data
=========================================================

Project 2 builds upon the exploratory data analysis conducted in Project 1 by analyzing a real sales dataset to uncover actionable insights and trends. The analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of sales performance and customer behavior to inform strategic decision-making.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis comprises real sales transactions spanning multiple time periods and product categories. It includes detailed information such as sales revenue, product lines, customer demographics, geographic regions, and more.

Objectives
----------
- Analyze sales performance across different product lines and geographic regions.
- Identify factors influencing sales trends and customer purchasing behavior.

Methodologies
